    <h2>About&nbsp;Me</h2>
    <p>
    In my research, I build computational models to understand how biological soft matter such as crosslinked biopolymer networks behave and fail under mechanical deformation. In my doctoral work under Prof. Fred MacKintosh and Prof. Anatoly Kolomeisky, I have worked on understanding lattice-based and off-lattice fiber networks (e.g. collagen,
actin/vimentin) that explore mechanical phase transitions (criticality), phenomena like strain-stiffening, spring-like stretching/bending, stress relaxation, and crosstalk between components of composite networks. 
     </p>
     <p>
These models provide deeper insights into the response of biomaterials under mechanical stimuli and turning floppy spring-like networks (biomaterials) into tunable rigid networks (or composites) for the desired response as well as material failure using computaional tools in soft matter and statistical mechanics. 
I am deeply interested in applying computational tools using principles of physics and chemical engineering to solve real world problems and drive innovation in the field of soft materials, healthcare and engineering. Please feel free to reach out for discussions or collaborations.

<p> Crosslinked fiber networks form a crucial part of biological systems contributing towards building tissues and are vital for processes like cell motility while being responsible for the structural
integrity. Their mechanical behavior is highly influenced by individual fiber properties and the network architecture, and so the average coordination number or connectivity (z) of the network architecture plays a critical role.ecent theories and experiments on fiber
network behavior have shown a strain-controlled rigidity transition. When subjected to finite incremental shear deformation, the networks transition from floppy to rigid
states at a critical strain threshold depending on the network connectivity and geometry. This transition exhibits rich critical phenomena and is second-order in nature. 
</p>
<p>Here are some movies that demonstrate their mechanical behavior:</p>
